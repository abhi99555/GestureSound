# Play.ME: Music that Grooves like you!
People often want to learn how to play instruments, but don't get the time for it. Our solution makes it as easy as waving your hands to your rhythm to play a variety of instruments!
Providing two different modes, we provide both a static, button-based interface as well as an interactive, gesture-based input to play the instrument. 
In the gesture mode, the user takes their phone in their right hand, and flicks it in two orientation: up and down with the screen facing up and with the screen facing right. Another button is provided on the screen to add additional sounds that can be played. 
Instruments Guitar and Drums are added, which can be chosen using a toggle on the top of the screen. For the guitar, the sounds of a classic chord combination are added, using which a variety of songs can be played, while for the drums, a snare, a hi-hat and a tomtom are added, which can make almost any beat you want to groove to.
